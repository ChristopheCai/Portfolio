    <h3 class="h3 service-title">Introduction</h3>

    <p> I made this project for my school project. We needed to do a Coin Runner on Unity. All the tools were free to use.<br>
        I spent 2 weeks on this project. <br>
        I used the following tools to make it :
        <ul>
            <li> - Unity</li>
            <li> - Unity Assets (AI Navigation, Cinemachine, Input System)</li>
            <li> - Sounds from Pixabay or Freesound</li>
            <li> - Models and textures from Sketchfab</li>
            <li> - Animation from Mixamo</li>
            <li> - Background from Dall-E</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Originality</h3>

            <p>This Coin Runner stands out by the atmosphere of horror game that isn't common in that
                kind of game. <br>
                The fact of having monsters keeping this too and in a original level design. <br>
                Each monsters have different behaviors depending on the level. <br>

            <h3 class="h3">Character</h3>

            <p>I've started to put a lot of my time for character controller to make the player
                feels the most confortable while using it. So I choose to use a Character Controller
                instead of a RigidBody because it offers more control on movement. <br>

            <h3 class="h3">Immersion</h3>
            
            <p>To immerse the player, audio and visual are important and being implemented.<br>
                I used a lot of time to consider those to match with the horror atmosphere
                I wanted to create. <br>
                I added Cinemachine to control the first and third person view in order to give the player
                more immersion on gameplay. <br>
                To make it even more immersive, I added a lots of animations for the player but also the objects
                interactable, the monsters, and others...
